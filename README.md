## For Developers: Running from Source

If you want to run or modify the source code, follow these instructions.

#### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**: Download and install from python.org. **Important:** During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
* **Android SDK Platform-Tools**: This contains `adb.exe`. Download the tools from the official Android developer website and place `adb.exe` (and its DLLs, if any) in the project folder.

#### Prepare and Run the Application
1.  Save the application's Python script (`android_backup_app.pyw`) inside your project folder.
2.  Ensure `adb.exe` is in the same folder.
3.  Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell and install the required Python libraries:

## How to Package into an EXE

You can package this application into a single `.exe` file using **PyInstaller**.

    pip install pyinstaller
    ```
2.  **Run the Packaging Command**:
    Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate to your project folder, and run the command below. To force the app to request admin privileges, you will first need to create the `admin.manifest` file mentioned in previous instructions.

    ```bash
    python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "adb.exe;." --manifest "admin.manifest" --icon="android.png" android_backup_app.pyw
